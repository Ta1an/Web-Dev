    <h1>The Rainbow
        <p>
        Boats sail on the rivers,<br>
And ships sail on the seas;<br>
But clouds that sail across the sky<br>
Are prettier far than these.<br>

There are bridges on the rivers,<br>
As pretty as you please;<br>
But the bow that bridges heaven,<br>
And overtops the trees,<br>
And builds a road from earth to sky,<br>
Is prettier far than these.<br>
        </p>
